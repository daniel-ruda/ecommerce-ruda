# E-commerce Sport Ruda

This is a sample E-commerce website to excel all the knowledge that was adquired in the React Course. The application uses
a list of Products from a Json Data and displays them into the Home Page. The website renders list stuff to fitness people such as Suplements, 
accesories, bikes, etc. The application displays the list of item for each category mentioned early and you can get the item's information clicking the item.

## Import Data

I have created the file products.js where you have the repository of the website.

## Live Demonstration

Here are screenshots that show the E-commerce website in use

## Tech Stack
* React
* Styled Components

For styles I decided to use Styled Component to avoid the complexity of others libreries such as BootStrap, Material-UI, etc.
